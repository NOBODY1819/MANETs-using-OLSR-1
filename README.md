# MANETs-using-OLSR
 The objective of this project is to implement the Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) and conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation. The focus will be on understanding the OLSR protocol, implementing it using NS2, and analyzing its behavior in a simulated MANET environment.
